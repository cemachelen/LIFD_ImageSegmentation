    "This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how artificial neural networks (ANNs) can be applied to image segmentation problems. Segmentation in this context refers to the task of assigning discrete labels to individual pixels or regions of an image. We can use segmentation models to identify and locate features of interest within an image. This notebook contains a simple application to self-driving cars, where we train a segmentation model to identify important features in dashcam footage, as well as a more complicated example, based on the work of [Coney et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1002/qj.4592), identifying and characterising trapped lee waves over the UK.\n",

    "## The problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Image segmentation models are designed to tackle the problem of partitioning an image into meaningful segments or regions, each corresponding to different objects or parts of objects within the image. This process is crucial in various applications such as medical imaging, where it helps in identifying and isolating different anatomical structures (e.g. organs or tumours), or in autonomous driving, where it can aid in recognising and distinguishing between pedestrians, vehicles, and road signs. By accurately segmenting images, these models enable more precise analysis and interpretation, facilitating tasks like object detection, scene understanding, and image editing. Essentially, image segmentation transforms raw visual data into structured information, making it easier for machines to understand and interact with the visual world. More recently, segmentation models are being applied to weather and climate forecasting applications, where their ability to identify structures in image data makes them ideally suited.\n",

    "* U-Net: Its architecture has become a standard in medical image segmentation due to its ability to perform well with limited training data and its precise localization capabilities.\n",
    "* Mask R-CNN: This model is highly significant for instance segmentation, as it not only detects objects but also provides pixel-level masks, making it versatile for various applications, including autonomous driving and video analysis.\n",
    "* DeepLab: Known for its high accuracy in semantic segmentation, DeepLab’s use of atrous convolution allows it to capture multi-scale context, making it a powerful tool for tasks requiring detailed scene understanding."

    "\n",
    "The [U-Net](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-24574-4_28) model architecture is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) originally designed for biomedical image segmentation. Introduced by Olaf Ronneberger, Philipp Fischer, and Thomas Brox in 2015, U-Net is known for its distinctive U-shaped structure. This architecture consists of a contracting path (the encoder) to capture context and a symmetric expanding path (the decoder) that enables precise localization. The contracting path follows the typical architecture of a convolutional network, with repeated application of convolutions, each followed by a rectified linear unit (ReLU) and a max-pooling operation. The expanding path, on the other hand, involves upsampling the feature maps and performing convolutions, which helps in reconstructing the image with high resolution. U-Net's ability to work with very few training images and its efficient use of data augmentation make it particularly effective for tasks where annotated data is scarce.\n",

    "PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. It is widely used for applications such as natural language processing and computer vision. PyTorch is known for its flexibility and ease of use, particularly due to its dynamic computation graph, which allows for more intuitive model building and debugging. However, it is considered quite low-level compared to some other frameworks (e.g. [Keras](https://keras.io/)), meaning that defining complex models like a U-Net can require a significant amount of verbose code. This verbosity can make the development process more cumbersome, especially for those who are new to deep learning.\n",

It provides a range of pre-built functions and classes that allow users to leverage the powerful capabilities of PyTorch without needing to write extensive amounts of code. With fastai, you can define and train complex models, such as U-Nets, in just a few lines of code. This makes it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced practitioners who want to quickly prototype and experiment with different models while still benefitting from the flexibility and performance of PyTorch under the hood.\n",

    "This example is based on the work of [Coney et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1002/qj.4592), who used neural networks to identify and characterise trapped lee waves over the UK. A lee wave is type of gravity wave created when air in the atmosphere flows over mountainous terrain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gravity waves\n",
    "\n",
    "A gravity wave is a vertical wave, for example a ripple, in the atmosphere. Gravity waves can be formed when air is forced upwards by topography (e.g. wind blowing over a mountain). This creates turbulence that can be felt throughout the column of air above a mountain. Gravity waves are of interest for improving our understanding and forecasting capability, e.g. for aviation. If you'd like to learn more, NOAA have a useful information page all about gravity waves in the atmosphere [here](https://www.weather.gov/source/zhu/ZHU_Training_Page/Miscellaneous/gravity_wave/gravity_wave.html).\n",
